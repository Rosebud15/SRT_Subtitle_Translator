1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,700
ooh

2
00:00:01,866 --> 00:00:05,133
no I don't feel confident in it at all

3
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:10,200
is difficult for even basic to get like jobs

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,966
I say research writing where doing what

5
00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:15,966
I didn't find it that useful as like a creative major

6
00:00:15,966 --> 00:00:18,500
as well as like an international student

7
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:21,100
yeah for people who actually take advantage of them

8
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,300
not me

9
00:00:22,366 --> 00:00:23,333
I am Christine

10
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:25,133
I'm currently working for

11
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:27,200
a career strategist company called Elite

12
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,400
Share or Ling Xuan

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,900
so first I want to ask you

14
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,566
have you been doing any internships

15
00:00:31,566 --> 00:00:34,300
I have not been doing any internships

16
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,766
I've applied to a couple and I've gotten like rejected

17
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:39,366
I haven't done any internships

18
00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:40,500
or like proper internships

19
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,800
because I've always missed the date by like that much

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,666
and it's driving me a little bit insane

21
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:48,800
but hopefully I can get that work experience

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,066
not yet unfortunately

23
00:00:51,066 --> 00:00:55,266
I have been on the search for like an internship but

24
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,666
I have not been able to get one

25
00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:01,200
so yeah but here's to hoping for next summer

26
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:04,066
what do you think of the current job market right now

27
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:05,966
like do you feel confident in it

28
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:07,966
ooh

29
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:11,300
no I don't feel confident in it at all

30
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,900
I am slightly dreading going

31
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,466
if I go to Santa Barbara having to

32
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:18,533
reapply for jobs

33
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:20,933
I never felt confident entering the job market

34
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:21,733
to begin with

35
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:22,133
just because

36
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:24,500
I don't feel like I have a lot of experience

37
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,166
I don't expect to get a full time job straight away

38
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:29,666
like I had watched my friend

39
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:33,300
as she graduated last year and had to apply for jobs

40
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,666
and it took her a while before she could get anything

41
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,100
so I was like looking at jobs and I was like ooh

42
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,933
this does not look good

43
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:43,400
like there were I was applying

44
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,000
there was when I was applying to jobs

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,800
before I got my current job

46
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,933
it was like a constant ghosting

47
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:50,966
like

48
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,966
I would apply to a job I did submit like my resume

49
00:01:53,966 --> 00:01:56,600
submit a cover letter and then no I'd hear

50
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,166
I wouldn't hear back from anyone

51
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,366
the job market right now

52
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,766
and the way that like

53
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:05,133
I guess HR and human resources deals with it

54
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:07,200
feels very disheartening

55
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,066
especially because they don't

56
00:02:09,266 --> 00:02:10,800
outright tell you no

57
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,100
they just like ghost and that is almost worse

58
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,000
what has been challenging for you while job hunting

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,066
I think the scope of it

60
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:23,400
I'm sure this is true of a lot of

61
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,533
graduates but especially for me

62
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:29,600
if I say oh I want to go into writing

63
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:32,766
well where doing what

64
00:02:32,766 --> 00:02:35,600
I say research writing where doing what

65
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,566
you know would I want to work full time for a company

66
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,466
is there specific company I want to work for like

67
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:44,666
do I want to focus on where in the work chain

68
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:46,400
am I involved in

69
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,100
so just the massive scope

70
00:02:49,266 --> 00:02:52,500
of opportunity is very alarming

71
00:02:52,566 --> 00:02:53,900
yeah that seems really difficult

72
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,466
to just narrow down what exactly you want to do

73
00:02:56,466 --> 00:02:58,700
have you used career services on campus

74
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,133
at all and have you found them to be helpful

75
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,500
I have actually not used career services

76
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,300
I

77
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,466
did think about getting in touch with them in the fall

78
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:10,933
but I just

79
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:13,733
didn't end up ever making an appointment with them

80
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:17,100
I did go to the career fair but

81
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,666
I didn't find it that useful

82
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,300
as like a creative major

83
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,666
as well as like an international student

84
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,266
you can't like they won't guide you around by the hand

85
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,533
there's like a good number of career fairs I've seen

86
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,766
and I'm like

87
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:31,866
and the department sends the emails with like

88
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:34,333
research opportunities and internships

89
00:03:34,466 --> 00:03:35,933
and those kinds of things

90
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:38,733
and like of course there's a like

91
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:42,200
department advisor you always you can always go to

92
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:44,666
so I feel like they have quite

93
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,100
they have good services

94
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,366
for people who want to like reach out to them

95
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:50,600
I see but for people who want to reach out

96
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,166
yeah for people who actually take advantage of them

97
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,333
not me

98
00:03:54,366 --> 00:03:55,533
it's most helpful

99
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:58,066
when you already know what questions to ask

100
00:03:58,066 --> 00:04:00,400
I know you know

101
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,566
all advisors are there

102
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:03,766
oftentimes just to help you identify

103
00:04:03,766 --> 00:04:05,766
what questions you need to ask

104
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:08,400
before you even know which ones you need

105
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,266
is there any advice that you give a high schooler

106
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:13,466
who's kind of currently uncertain about their future

107
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:17,133
don't do exactly what I did but at the same time

108
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:21,300
really exploring your options I think will help you

109
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,466
figure out what you want to do

110
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:25,966
the easiest thing is to just put yourself out there

111
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:26,766
it's great

112
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,100
if you can find something that you love to do

113
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,000
but just like

114
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,933
to get the experience on some level

115
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:33,100
is probably the best

116
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,333
if you're less of a like

117
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,200
I mean right now

118
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,300
especially the job market being what is

119
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,066
at least here in the US

120
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:46,333
is difficult for even basic to get like jobs

121
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:50,100
like what is it entry level was even pretty difficult

122
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:51,966
I would have to say that like

123
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:54,166
just putting yourself out there is normally

124
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,800
is like a pretty great idea

125
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,200
what you're actually gonna get

126
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,666
while when you put yourself out there is debatable

127
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,400
but it's a journey for all of us

128
00:05:02,766 --> 00:05:04,866
and it's not going to happen

129
00:05:04,866 --> 00:05:06,500
if you don't take that first step
